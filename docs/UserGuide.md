## About

PressPal is designed to streamline contact and interview management for breaking news reporters. Traditional address books and note-taking tools are not optimized for the high-speed, high-pressure environment of news reporting, where reporters must manage hundreds of contacts across multiple sources (phones, emails, notebooks).
The goal of PressPal is to:
- Provide reporters with a single command-driven system for organizing and retrieving contacts quickly.
- Enable fast entry and retrieval of context (interview history, organization, role, notes) while working on multiple stories simultaneously.
- Support the entire lifecycle of a contact — from initial outreach, to active follow-up, to archiving once a story concludes.
  Ultimately, PressPal aims to reduce cognitive load for reporters, allowing them to focus on storytelling while ensuring no lead, contact, or follow-up is lost.

### User Profiles
- Users with basic familiarity with Windows/macOS/Linux file navigation and opening a terminal.
- Users who favor CLI over GUI and type quickly.
- Users who manage an extensive network of contacts and numerous scheduled interviews to monitor.

### System Requirements
- Java 17 (or newer) installed and available on the PATH.
- Operating System: Windows, macOS, or Linux

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.<br>
   **Mac users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).

1. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-W08-1/tp/releases/tag/v1.3).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your ContactBook.

1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar presspal.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all contacts.

   * `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com r/Student o/NUS c/friends c/owesMoney` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Contact Book.

   * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.

   * `clear` : Deletes all contacts.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [c/CATEGORY]` can be used as `n/John Doe c/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[c/CATEGORY]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `c/friend`, `c/friend c/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

### Editing the data file

ContactBook data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/contactbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, ContactBook will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the ContactBook to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside of the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</div>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous ContactBook home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
