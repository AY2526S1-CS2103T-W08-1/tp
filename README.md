## About
PressPal is designed to streamline contact and interview management for breaking news reporters. Traditional address books and note-taking tools are not optimized for the high-speed, high-pressure environment of news reporting, where reporters must manage hundreds of contacts across multiple sources (phones, emails, notebooks).

The goal of PressPal is to:
- Provide reporters with a single command-driven system for organizing and retrieving contacts quickly.
- Enable fast entry and retrieval of context (interview history, organization, role, notes) while working on multiple stories simultaneously.
- Support the entire lifecycle of a contact â€” from initial outreach, to active follow-up, to archiving once a story concludes.

Ultimately, PressPal aims to reduce cognitive load for reporters, allowing them to focus on storytelling while ensuring no lead, contact, or follow-up is lost.

## UI
